Lab Information
---------------

There is a lab section for this course. It takes place at the MIT Tow Tank and MIT Propeller Tunnel. The labs are designed each year to incorporate the information from the course into a complete package. Some labs from the previous years include:

*   Drag on a 2D Cylinder
*   Submersible
*   Hull Tests
*   2D Airfoil
*   Wave Forces

Groups of 3 (preferably) to 4 (maximum) students are formed and the groups work together throughout the lab. Individual Lab reports are required. The lab portion is typically 10% of the final grade.

Lab Report Policy
-----------------

Lab reports are to be done on an individual basis, though lab work will be done in groups of two or three depending on class size. Labs take up 10% of your final grade, and therefore should not be overlooked. There are three components to your overall lab grade:

*   Prelab Report: Prelab reports are important not to just make you read the lab sheet before you walk into lab. They are an integral part of any lab to encourage thinking through the lab before actually doing the lab. Prelab reports are informal and should include any information you feel is necessary, a basic outline of your approach to the lab, and, if necessary, tables to record the information. This will not only increase your grade but increase your efficiency in the lab.
*   Observations: As part of the lab you will be required to observe another group's work and comment, objectively, on lesson's you learned from watching them. By watching others, you will be able to see what will and won't work without the added pressure of actually performing the lab.
*   Lab Report: This is the final document on your entire lab experience. It will include your prelab report, observations, and **formal** report of what happened in your lab and it's results.
