For this course, three software packages were developed to help students understand concepts and of course to do homework.

These three software packages are:

1.  P-Flow: To run P-Flow, you need to download and install the file J2SE 1.4.2 from: [J2SE Downloads](http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/index.html).
2.  AMass: To run Amass, you need to download and install Java 3D from: [1.3.1 API Download](http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/download.html).
3.  Wave Partial Reflection : To run P-Flow you need to download and install the file J2SE 1.4.2 from: [J2SE Downloads](http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/index.html).

To run the tools in this section, first download the appropriate Java files and accept the applet. Tutorial files are provided to assist in using the tools. In addition, you can download the executable files if you would like to experiment further with the tools.
